# Drupal API Client

### Coding Standards
This project is being developed with a slight variation of the [Drupal JavaScript coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/javascript/javascript-coding-standards), in order to have guidelines that work well with TypeScript.  Since the AirBnb style guide does not officially have TypeScript support, we are using the [eslint-config-airbnb-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) package to add Typescript compatibility. We are also using [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) instead of [JSDoc3](https://jsdoc.app/) to standardize our doc comments.
