Welcome to the Drupal API Client documentation!

## What is the Drupal API Client?

[The Drupal API Client](https://www.drupal.org/project/api_client) is a set of JavaScript packages that simplify the process of interacting with common Drupal APIs. Most commonly, developers will use our [JSON:API client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client) to interface with Drupal's JSON:API endpoints, but we also publish a [base API Client package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-api-client/api-client) that can be extended, a [client for Decoupled Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-api-client/decoupled-router-client), and may support other Drupal APIs in the future.

The Drupal API Client takes great care to be framework-agnostic and universal. It can be used:

- with your JavaScript framework of choice, vanilla JavaScript, or even in Drupal itself.
- with or without TypeScript.
- on the server, or on the client.
- with a bundler, or as a script import from a CDN.

## Hello Umami!

Below is a simple example that uses [@drupal-api-client/json-api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client) to list the titles of all articles in Drupal's Umami Demo Profile. What you see below is a live example sourcing data from a Drupal instance at build time.

<Aside>
  By default, our live examples are rendered using [Astro
  components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) as the
  syntax ends up being very framework agnostic. JavaScript code is fenced within
  `---`, with markup included below. For guidance on using your framework of
  choice, be sure to see the ['Using with
  Frameworks'](/with-frameworks/overview/) section of this documentation.

import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io",
);
const articles = await client.getCollection("node--article");

<h2>Umami Articles</h2>
<ul>
  {articles.data.map((article) => (
    <li key={article.id}>{article.attributes.title}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

Continue on to dig deeper in to what is possible with the client.
