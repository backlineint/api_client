The Drupal API Client can be used within a Drupal site (often called progressive decoupling).

## Loading your JavaScript as a module

Given the following JavaScript that loads the JSON:API Client from a CDN:

```js
// api-client-examples.js
import { JsonApiClient } from "https://esm.run/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

const client = new JsonApiClient(window.location.origin);
const actions = await client.getCollection("node--article");
```

You will need to load this JavaScript as a module in your Drupal site by adding the following to a `libraries.yml` file in your module or theme:

```yml
# api_client_examples.libraries.yml
api_client_examples:
  js:
    js/api-client-examples.js: { attributes: { type: module } }
```

## Using a dynamic baseUrl

In the previous example, you'll note that the `baseUrl` argument is being set to `window.location.origin`.

```js {4}
// api-client-examples.js
import { JsonApiClient } from "https://esm.run/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

const client = new JsonApiClient(window.location.origin);
const actions = await client.getCollection("node--article");
```

In a progressively decoupled Drupal site, this will allow the client to make requests to the same domain as the Drupal site without having to specify different values on non-production environments.

## Inheriting authentication

When used inside of your Drupal site, the client will inherit the current user session by automatically including any cookies that are set by Drupal when making requests.

Given the following JavaScript:

```js
// api-client-example.js
import { JsonApiClient } from "https://esm.run/@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

const client = new JsonApiClient(window.location.origin);
const actions = await client.getCollection("action--action");
console.log("This request requires authentication", actions);
```

In a browser window logged in as a user with the 'administer actions' permission, you will see results for the 'action' collection. As an unauthenticated in an incognito window you will see no results.
