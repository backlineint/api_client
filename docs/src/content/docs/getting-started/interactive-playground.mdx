import PlaygroundEmbed from "../../../components/PlaygroundEmbed.astro";

Use the interactive playground below to experiment with the Drupal API Client. Toggle between preview and editor tabs to make updates and see the changes in real-time. Or fork on StackBlitz to work on your own copy in a new tab.

## React Playground

<PlaygroundEmbed />

## Things to try

Try making the following changes in App.jsx in the editor.

- When creating the `JsonApiClient` instance, change the `baseUrl` to point to your own Drupal site
- When calling `getCollection` provide a different resource type, e.g. `node--page`
- Use [JSON:API Parameters](/jsonapi-tutorial/parameters/) to modify the response for the collection.
