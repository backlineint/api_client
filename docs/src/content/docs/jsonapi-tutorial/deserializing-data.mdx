title: Deserializing Data
---

import { Aside, Code, TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";
import { Jsona } from "jsona";
import JsonView from "react18-json-view";

import "react18-json-view/src/style.css";

export const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io",
  {
    serializer: new Jsona(),
  },
);

export const recipes = await client.getCollection("node--recipe", {
  queryString: "include=field_media_image.thumbnail",
});

export const fileUrl = recipes[0].field_media_image.thumbnail.uri.url;

When adding images to our recipes grid, we had to do quite a bit of traversing to get the data we needed due to the structure of relationships and included data in JSON:API responses.

```js
// Get field_media_image referenced on the recipe
const mediaId = recipe.relationships.field_media_image.data.id;
const mediaEntity = recipes.included.find((obj) => obj.id === mediaId);
// Get the thumbnail file entity referenced on field_media_image
const fileId = mediaEntity.relationships.thumbnail.data.id;
const alt = mediaEntity.relationships.thumbnail.data.meta.alt;
const fileEntity = recipes.included.find((obj) => obj.id === fileId);
```

We can simplify this by using the `serializer` option when creating our client instance, along with a library like [Jsona](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsona). This will provide a simplified and flattened response when data is returned from the server.

## The serializer Option

Revisiting the creation of our JsonApiClient instance, we can add an options object as the second argument. This object can include a serializer property, which can be used to transform the data provided by JSON:API.The provided serializer object can have two methods: `deserializer` and `serializer`. An instance of [Jsona](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsona) fits that signature.

Let's update our client instance to use the `Jsona` serializer.

```js
import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";
import { Jsona } from "jsona";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io",
  {
    serializer: new Jsona(),
  },
);
```

## Deserializing Data

Now that we have provided a compatible serializer, all data sourced from Drupal will be deserialized automatically.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    ```js ins={8-10}
    import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

    const client = new JsonApiClient(
      "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io", {
        serializer: new Jsona(),
      },
    );
    const recipes = await client.getCollection("node--recipe", {
      queryString: "include=field_media_image.thumbnail",
    });

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Data">
    <JsonView client:only collapsed={1} src={recipes} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Taking a look at the `recipes` object, you'll see that the data is now flatter and easier to access. For example, field_media_image is now a direct property of the recipe data, and the thumbnail file is directly accessible from this media entity. We could get the thumbnail url for the first recipe result like this:

```js
const thumbnailUrl = recipe[0].field_media_image.thumbnail.uri.url;
```

## Refactoring the Recipe Grid

Let's see the impact that working with deserialized data has on our recipe grid. We can refactor the grid to use this new flattened data structure.

```astro live {6, 34, 36, 38, 40-41, 43, 46} ins={7-8}
---
import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";
import { Jsona } from "jsona";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io", {
    serializer: new Jsona(),
  },
);
const recipes = await client.getCollection("node--recipe", {
  queryString: "include=field_media_image.thumbnail",
});
---
<style>
  .card-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-gap: 1rem;
  }

  .card-grid .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    border: 2px solid var(--sl-color-text-accent);
    margin-top: 0;
    padding: 0.5rem;
  }
</style>

<div>
  <h2>Umami Recipes</h2>
  <div class="card-grid">
    {recipes.map((recipe) => (
      <div class="card" key={recipe.id}>
        <h4>{recipe.title}</h4>
        <div>
        <p>Difficulty: {recipe.field_difficulty}</p>
        <img
          src=`${client.baseUrl}${recipe.field_media_image.thumbnail.uri.url}`
          alt={recipe.field_media_image.thumbnail.resourceIdObjMeta.alt}
        />
        <a href={recipe.path.alias}>View Recipe</a>
        </div>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

The end result is the same, so choose the option that is best for your team. Use the client default to work with the JSON:API response as is, or use the `serializer` option to work with a simplified object.

## Serializing Data

In cases where you need serialize or re-serialize the data before sending it to the server, you will have access to the `serializer` method on the client instance. Below is an example of using Jsona's serializer.

```js
import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";
import { Jsona } from "jsona";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://dev-drupal-api-client-poc.pantheonsite.io",
  {
    serializer: new Jsona(),
  },
);

// This recipe will be deserialized automatically
const recipe = await getResource(
  "node--recipe",
  "35f7cd32-2c54-49f2-8740-0b0ec2ba61f6",
);

// If we later need to re-serialize the recipe we can do so like this
const serializedRecipe = client.serializer.serialize({ stuff: recipe });
```

Since the signature of these serializer methods tend to vary, the JSON:API client doesn't currently serialize data automatically, but it will be available for use if provided.
