title: Optimizing Performance
---

There are many approaches to optimize performance when interacting with Drupal's JSON:API endpoints. This guide will cover some of the most common strategies.

## Caching data

When creating an instance of the client, it is possible to provide a cache to store data returned from JSON:API. This can have a big impact on performance, especially in cases when the same data is requested multiple times.

### Using the default cache

For a simple way to cache responses, the API Client provides a default cache based on the [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) library. To use it, create an instance of the cache using the `createCache` function and pass it to the client when creating an instance.

```astro live
---
import { JsonApiClient, createCache } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://drupal-api-demo.party", {
    cache: createCache(),
  }
);
const recipes = await client.getCollection("node--recipe");
---
<h2>Umami Recipes</h2>
<ul>
  {recipes.data.map((recipe) => (
    <li key={recipe.id}>{recipe.attributes.title}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

```

The first call to `getCollection` will fetch the data from the server and store it in the cache. Subsequent calls to `getCollection` for `node--recipe` will return the data from the cache, which can significantly reduce the number of requests made to the server.

### Using a custom cache

In addition to the default cache, an alternative cache can be used. The provided cache needs to be compatible with the ApiClient `cache` interface. This interface expects the cache to have `get` and `set` methods.

As an example, let's look at how we could use the [node-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache) package.

```astro
---
import { JsonApiClient } from "@drupal-api-client/json-api-client";
import NodeCache from "node-cache";

const client = new JsonApiClient(
  "https://drupal-api-demo.party", {
    cache: new NodeCache(),
  }
);
const recipes = await client.getCollection("node--recipe");
---
<h2>Umami Recipes</h2>
<ul>
  {recipes.data.map((recipe) => (
    <li key={recipe.id}>{recipe.attributes.title}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

```
